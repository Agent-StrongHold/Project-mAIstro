# #845 host-authorized delegation and execution tiers

The new core tests prove that a host grant binds the agent, owner, target,
Goal/Run/Invocation, scope, exact artifact, expiry, and provenance; the
resulting effective action set is an intersection rather than a target
manifest grant; approvals cannot be reused for another artifact; and an
agent manifest cannot delegate without a host grant. The Hive adapter tests
prove request `execution_tier` values do not select isolation and
`tier_approved_by` metadata cannot clear a host block.
