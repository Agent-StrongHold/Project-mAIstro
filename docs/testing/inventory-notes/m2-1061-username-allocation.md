# M2 #1061 canonical username allocation

Nine focused tests cover many case-variant writers across two independent
SQLite state writers, rollback of a claim when the user insert fails, release
of a claim and account as one rollback transaction, the live atomic storage
seam, setup rollback after a post-allocation failure, voice resolution through
the canonical quarantine, historical duplicate quarantine, and a mutation guard
against restoring the old scan-then-random-write registration path. The first
test is intentionally a real multi-writer race rather than a process-local lock
test.

The mutation criterion is executed, not only asserted statically:
`test_scan_then_write_mutation_loses_the_race` runs the same concurrent harness
against a deliberately mutated allocator with the historical read-then-write
shape (barrier forced inside the check-to-write window) and proves the identity
duplicates — the exact failure the atomic seam prevents. Replacing the register
route's `username_registry.create_users` call with the historical
`_username_taken()` scan plus random-id write was also executed by hand during
repair; `test_registration_route_uses_atomic_allocator_not_scan_then_write`
fails under that mutation, and the suite was green again after reverting.

The conftest gains an autouse `_isolate_username_claims` fixture: the claim
index is process-global like the users store, and without per-test isolation an
active claim from one test makes another test's fresh-users setup observe the
name as taken.
