"""Explicit Vulture references for framework/public surfaces in maistro-core.

This module is quality-scanner input only. ``maistro-core`` packages only
``src/maistro``, so this file is not shipped in the wheel. Vulture scans the
whole ``src`` directory and therefore sees these references to symbols whose
usage is implicit through Pydantic or intentionally external through the public
Invocation execution API.
